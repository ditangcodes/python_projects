**CREATING A WEB SCRAPER**

Creating a web scraper that extracts job postings matching specific criteria, converts the data into CSV format, and populates a spreadsheet involves several steps. Here's a general outline of how you might proceed:

- Identify the Job Posting Website: Determine the website where the job postings are listed. You'll need to inspect the structure of the webpage to identify the HTML elements that contain the job details.

- Send HTTP Requests: Use the requests library in Python to send HTTP requests to the website. This will allow you to retrieve the HTML content of the page.

- Parse the HTML Content: Use a library like BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content and extract the job details. You can filter out the job postings based on your criteria.

- Store the Data: Once you have the job details, store them in a suitable data structure, such as a list of dictionaries or a pandas DataFrame. Each dictionary or DataFrame row should represent a single job posting.

- Convert to CSV Format: Use the pandas library to convert the data to CSV format. You can use the to_csv() function to accomplish this.

- Populate Spreadsheet: Finally, you can use the openpyxl library to open the CSV file and populate a spreadsheet. You can either append the data to an existing spreadsheet or create a new one.
